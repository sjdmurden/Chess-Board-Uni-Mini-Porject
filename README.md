This project aimed to calculate the probability of a disk landing on a chess board and covering more than one colour where a square's length on the board is the diameter of the disk.

It was very statistics heavy and I used Python for my final calculations after rough work on paper. It was my first time using LaTeX so it was interesting to see what it was capable of. Exploring the 'math' text, 'tikz' package, and integration of Python code were things I used, and overall I enjoyed my introduction to LaTeX and having good looking visual file as an end product.

The LaTeX and PDF files are included above.
