# Chess_board_uni_project

This project aimed to calculate the probability of a disk landing on a chess board and covering more than one colour where a square's length on the board is the diameter of the disk.

It was very statistics heavy and I used Python for my calculations. I then used LaTeX to present it as a PDF.

The LaTeX and PDF files are above.
